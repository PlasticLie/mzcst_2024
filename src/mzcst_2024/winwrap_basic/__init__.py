"""The CST Studio Suite tools can be controlled from a Visual Basic (VBA) script. The language of the built in BASIC interpreter is almost 100% compatible with the Visual Basic for Application language. This language may be used either for creating own structure libraries or for the automation of common tasks.

A powerful environment can be used for automating any task within its modules or even in combination with external programs. The powerful VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) compatible macro language is equipped with a fully featured development environment including an editor and a debugger. An interface to OLE automation enables a seamless integration into the Windows environment (e.g. Microsoft Office®, MATLAB®, AutoCAD®, MathCAD®, Windows Scripting Host, etc.). The editor opens automatically if a macro is edited or created. It can also be opened by selecting Home: Macros > Open VBA Macro Editor
